# RPGShopManager
A demo project used to help explain programming concepts.

## What the project will do
1. Have two shop workers performing a list of daily tasks, most notably operating the till
2. Other tasks will include stocking shelves, cleaning the shop, ordering more stock
3. The shop keeper managing the till will provide certain functionalities to the customer: buying an item, buying multiple of a stackable item, selling an item, selling multiple of a stackable item, selling everything all at once
4. The worker task performing system will run on a loop, with each iteration representing 10 minutes
5. Customers will be randomly generated with inventories of items and gold, and enter the shop to buy and sell items randomly too
6. The customers will queue to buy/sell items
7. The more "etc" type items the customer has, the longer it will take to sell
8. The less "use" type items the customer has the longer it will take to buy
9. The more expensive an "equip" type item is the longer it will take to buy, as the customer "contemplates" on their purchase
10. A customer will only sell a piece of equipment if they have multiple of that type (e.g. a helmet), in this instance they will sell the one with the worst stats
